                                            IM-Manufacturing LLC has crafted manufacturing strategies that combine overall business strategy and functional strategies. In practice, having a manufacturing strategy, which shapes the structure, infrastructure and capabilities of a firmâ€™s manufacturing
                                            function, does not ensure the success of a business. The strategic approach must be combined with a practical approach to continuous improvement at an operational level if a company is to produce products at
                                            the rate, quality and cost that ensure competitiveness in their chosen markets.
                                            <br> <br> A key component of a manufacturing strategy is the definition of whether products are to be manufactured at the traditional manufacturing sites, or if the cost benefits offered make it beneficial to
                                            set up manufacturing in geographic areas with a low cost base (e.g. Eastern Europe, South America, China). Although it may often look appealing to set-up in low cost base areas, full account needs to be taken
                                            of the practical and logistical difficulties and the full financial implications of setting up and operating facilities in remote, underdeveloped countries. With the arrival of e-commerce and the virtual ease
                                            with which suppliers across the world can be identified and contracted to manufacture parts or complete products, many companies have benefited from the use of outsourcing of manufacturing in their strategic
                                            plans.
